### Problem Statement:
We would like to visualize various aspects of our hotel bookings data through dashboard to gain insights and understand key trends. We need to analyze key indicators for our hotel bookings data to gain insights into our business performance.
### KPI Requirement:
1.	Revenue - To get the total revenue realized.
2.	RevPar - RevPAR represents the revenue generated per available room, whether or not they are occupied.
3.	Occupancy - Occupancy is the total successful bookings happened to the total rooms available(capacity).
4.	ADR - It is the measure of the average paid for rooms sold in a given time period.
5.	DSRN - This metrics tells on average how many rooms are ready to sell for a day considering a time period.
6.	Realisation - It is the successful "checked out" percentage over all bookings happened.
### Objective:
The objective of this data analysis is to create analytical dashboard for hotel bookings that showcases KPI’s and key trends over a period of time or by properties.
### Research questions:
1.	How does key metrics contribute to overall contribution to revenue?
2.	How does key metrics vary over months and weeks?
3.	Do particular city or room type impact on hotel revenue?
4.	What is the relationship between ADR, RevPar and Occupancy?
5.	What is the percentage of revenue by hotel type and their overall contribution to revenue?
6.	How do RevPar, Occupancy, ADR and Realisation vary over weekdays and weekends?
7.	How do realisation and ADR vary over booking platforms?
8.	Which are the top 5 and bottom 5 hotels over key metrics?
### Insights:
1.	Trends by key metrics line graph shows occupancy is 50% in some weeks, which greatly impacts on revenue.
2.	Also average daily rate is constant over all months, as can be seen in Trends by key metrics graph.
3.	From the pie chat that represents Revenue percentage by hotel category, shows almost 62% of revenue is generated from Luxury hotels and rest from Business hotels.
4.	By observing key trends over weekends and weekdays, ADR is similar on both weekdays and weekends. Occupancy is less than 65% in both days and Realisation is almost 70% in both weekdays and weekends.
5.	Bar and line graph which represents Realisation % and ADR by booking channel, shows all channels almost have 70% realisation.
6.	Direct offline bookings has highest ADR and Direct online bookings has lowest ADR but not as much low comparing to other.
7.	Property by key metrics table shows occupancy decreases as rating decreases.
### Suggestions:
1.	Occupancy should be increased by lowering ADR on specific days, weeks or seasons.
2.	ADR should vary over weekdays and weekends which will lead to higher revenue.
3.	ADR is similar for both Luxury and Business hotels, which may be varied for higher revenue.
4.	ADR can be made further low on their own booking channel, as they don’t pay any commission.
5.	As rating impacts occupancy, customer satisfaction should be improved and increase the quality of hotels.
